H1-B Case Study

The H1B is an employment-based, non-immigrant visa category for temporary foreign workers in the United States. For a foreign national to apply for H1B visa, an US employer must offer a job and petition for H1B visa with the US immigration department. This is the most common visa status applied for and held by international students once they complete college/ higher education (Masters, Ph.D.) and work in a full-time position.
